I added "head, tail, start_in_array, end_in_array" to the end of each array for each stack, because this would remove the need to move every element in a stack when rotating. But the need still exists if I am pushing to a stack with head not equal to start_in_array. But it still reduces the number of moves, in general, because when pushing, I don't need to move every element -- need to move only the elements from head to end_in_array or from tail to start_in_array.
